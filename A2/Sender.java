{
    /*
     * Predefined Constant (static member variables):
     *
     *   int MAXDATASIZE : the maximum size of the Message data and
     *                     Packet payload
     *
     *
     * Predefined Member Methods:
     *
     *  void startTimer(double increment):
     *       Starts a timer, which will expire in
     *       "increment" time units, causing the interrupt handler to be
     *       called.  You should only call this in the Sender class.
     *  void stopTimer():
     *       Stops the timer. You should only call this in the Sender class.
     *  void udtSend(Packet p)
     *       Sends the packet "p" into the network to arrive at other host
     *  void deliverData(String dataSent)
     *       Passes "dataSent" up to application layer. Only call this in the
     *       Receiver class.
     *  double getTime()
     *       Returns the current time of the simulator.  Might be useful for
     *       debugging.
     *  String getReceivedData()
     *       Returns a String with all data delivered to receiving process.
     *       Might be useful for debugging. You should only call this in the
     *       Sender class.
     *  void printEventList()
     *       Prints the current event list to stdout.  Might be useful for
     *       debugging, but probably not.
     *

     *  Predefined Classes:
     *
     *  Message: Used to encapsulate the message coming from application layer
     *    Constructor:
     *      Message(String inputData):
     *          creates a new Message containing "inputData"
     *    Methods:
     *      boolean setData(String inputData):
     *          sets an existing Message's data to "inputData"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      String getData():
     *          returns the data contained in the message
     *  Packet: Used to encapsulate a packet
     *    Constructors:
     *      Packet (Packet p):
     *          creates a new Packet, which is a copy of "p"
     *      Packet (int seq, int ack, int check, String newPayload)
     *          creates a new Packet with a sequence field of "seq", an
     *          ack field of "ack", a checksum field of "check", and a
     *          payload of "newPayload"
     *      Packet (int seq, int ack, int check)
     *          chreate a new Packet with a sequence field of "seq", an
     *          ack field of "ack", a checksum field of "check", and
     *          an empty payload
     *    Methods:
     *      boolean setSeqnum(int n)
     *          sets the Packet's sequence field to "n"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      boolean setAcknum(int n)
     *          sets the Packet's ack field to "n"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      boolean setChecksum(int n)
     *          sets the Packet's checksum to "n"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      boolean setPayload(String newPayload)
     *          sets the Packet's payload to "newPayload"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      int getSeqnum()
     *          returns the contents of the Packet's sequence field
     *      int getAcknum()
     *          returns the contents of the Packet's ack field
     *      int getChecksum()
     *          returns the checksum of the Packet
     *      String getPayload()
     *          returns the Packet's payload
